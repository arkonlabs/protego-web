# Privacy Policy for Protego

Last updated: November 7, 2024

## Overview
Protego is a Safari extension that helps users filter Reddit posts based on keywords. We take your privacy seriously and have designed our extension to operate entirely on your device without collecting any personal information.

## Information Collection and Use
Protego does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Here's how the extension works:

- **Keyword Storage**: All keywords you add to filter posts are stored locally on your device only
- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, transmit, or store any user data
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics or tracking tools
- **Local Processing**: All post filtering happens directly in your browser
- **No Remote Servers**: The extension operates entirely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers

## Your Data Rights
Since Protego does not collect any personal information, there is no user data for us to manage, share, or delete. All your filter keywords remain under your complete control on your local device.

## Changes to Filtering Settings
- All keywords you add or remove are stored only in your browser
- You can export your keywords locally for backup
- You can import keywords from a local file
- These operations happen entirely on your device

## Third-Party Services
Protego operates solely as a Safari extension and does not interact with any third-party services. While the extension filters content from Reddit.com, it does not send any information to Reddit or any other services.

## Changes to This Policy
If we make any changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
